You can run the scripts using the following command on a Linux system:
./(script name)

For example:
./scriptsunix.txt

NOTE: use scriptsunix.txt if scripts.txt does not work
You will need to have cURL installed to run the scripts.

Use the following command on a Debian system to install cURL:
sudo apt-get install curl
