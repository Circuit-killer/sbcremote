# sbcremote
SBC remote for M2M Circuits

An open-source mobile application which enables users to remotely manipulate the GPIO unit of a Raspberry Pi. The project will build on top of emerging technology such as the Maker Modem, Weaved, and WebIOPi to remotely control single-board computers. The mobile application will integrate WebIOPi to let users control their Raspberry Pis remotely. The GUI will contain a configuration screen that will allow the user to change I/O signals. Additionally, the user will be notified when I/O signals change or some event occurs
